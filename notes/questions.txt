Is a word 16-bits or 32-bits!!!
Text contradicts itself
Also so does internet

Page 51: declaring Word (16-bit) variables in the example program
Page 77: DDD debugger <u> unit size halfword (16-bits), word (32-bits)
  Word is 16-bits, debugger has the funny naming
  This is the rule

Gah!


Why even say what data size? Why not just say which register and let it be implied?


Why did ld -g not work on my mac?

Why is -f elf64 "not appropriate" for my mac?
  elf64 - specific to instruction set, cpu architecture, or operating system?
  64-bit operating system is a) different operating system for b) a different cpu architecture
  cpu architecture interchangeable with instruction set here?
  ELF refers to a kernel's "executable format"

Is an OS kernel written for a specific microarchitecture or instruction set?
  Must be specific to an instruction set.

How expensive (# of operations) to end and start a new while loop?
Compared to doing a boolean comparison at the start of each iteration?
  Like once Part A is done and the compar. will always == false, j = i and
    new loop while j < max?
    How many comparisons until it's worth it to start a separate while loop
    that doesn't include them?
      Measured in memory and operations
