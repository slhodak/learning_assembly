Is a word 16-bits or 32-bits!!!
Text contradicts itself
Also so does internet

Page 51: declaring Word (16-bit) variables in the example program
Page 77: DDD debugger <u> unit size halfword (16-bits), word (32-bits)
  Word is 16-bits, debugger has the funny naming
  This is the rule

Gah!


Why even say what data size? Why not just say which register and let it be implied?
